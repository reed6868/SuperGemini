## Security Considerations

### Configuration Framework Security
- SuperGemini is a configuration framework, not executable software
- No network connections or data transmission
- Files are stored locally in ~/.gemini/
- Shell scripts have limited system access
- Template reference system (@pattern) validated for integrity

### Installation Security
- install.sh performs file operations only
- No sudo/admin privileges required
- Backup existing configurations before installation
- All operations within user home directory

### Usage Security
- Configuration files are read-only for Gemini CLI
- No sensitive data stored in configurations
- Slash commands execute through Gemini CLI's security model
- MCP integrations follow Gemini CLI's sandbox restrictions

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Review install.sh before execution
- Keep SuperGemini updated
- Report suspicious behavior
- Use official installation methods only

### For Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate all user inputs
- Test security implications of changes

## Scope

This security policy covers:
- SuperGemini configuration files
- Installation scripts
- GitHub repository security
- Community interaction security

## Disclaimer

SuperGemini is provided "as is" without warranty. While we strive for security, users are responsible for:
- Reviewing code before installation
- Using in appropriate environments
- Following Gemini CLI security guidelines
- Backing up existing configurations
